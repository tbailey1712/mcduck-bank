**A self‚Äëhosted family banking ledger built entirely with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).**

McDuck Bank lets parents manage allowances and savings for the whole family. It is not a real bank account service‚Äîthink of it as an open source digital piggy bank. You'll need some JavaScript and Firebase know‚Äëhow to deploy your own instance.
