# McDuck Bank - Minimalist Online Banking App

A modern, minimalist online banking application built with React and deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This application uses Firebase for authentication and data storage, with Google Auth integration.

## Features

- Google Authentication
- Role-based access control (Admin/Customer)
- Transaction management system
- Pending withdrawal approval workflow
- Responsive Material-UI design
- Cloud-native architecture

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, Redux Toolkit, Material-UI
- Authentication: Google Auth via Firebase
- Database: Firebase Firestore
- Deployment: Google Cloud Platform

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure Firebase:
- Create a Firebase project
- Enable Google Auth
- Add your Firebase configuration to `.env` file:
```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

```

## Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed on Google Cloud Platform. Follow these steps:

1. Create a GCP project
2. Enable required APIs (Cloud Run, Cloud Build, etc.)
3. Configure Cloud Build triggers for CI/CD
4. Deploy using Cloud Run

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is stored in Firebase Firestore
- Google Auth provides secure authentication
- Role-based access control implemented
- All API endpoints are authenticated
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration

## Future Enhancements

- iOS companion app integration
- Enhanced transaction history
- Additional admin features
- Real-time notifications
- More detailed reporting capabilities

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
